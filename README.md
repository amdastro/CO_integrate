# CO_integrate
Newtonian integration of CO abundances

# To run
Specify runtime parameters in parameters.py
$ run COintegrate.py



# More explanation later: 
- abundaces.py and reaction.py define functions for CO abundances and reaction rates
- COintegrate performs the time evolution, solving for the CO abundance with rudimentary adaptive time-stepping.
